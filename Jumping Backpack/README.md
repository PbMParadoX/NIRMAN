## Problem Statement
Now a days we see a lot of people are facing back and spinal problem at very early age. And according to many surveys conducted it has been found that most spinal and back problem cases occur due to lack of exercise, excess weight and improper lifting. We have tried to solve these issues faced by designing a JUMPING BACKPACK.
## Solution Approach
The main problem is the heavy load that we carry in the bag. If by any means we can reduce the direct load that is exerted by the bag on our back then we can solve the problem upto a great extend. So, we detached the direct contact of the bag from the body. Then the contact was made with the help of elastic or we can use spring which helps the bag to susupend itself when an external force is applied. Our aim is to reduce the actual weight upto a certain extent that is caried by the user and bagpack don't give the total load on the user's back. 
## Tech Stack
We have used a simple spring and elastic mechanism in which the overall force is divided into smaller components. Currently this idea is under developing stage and we have planned to implement a lot new things and make it affordable to the common public.
